# My cs50 projects
---
During the 2020 summer holiday I was learning CS from the Harvard's cs50 course. This repo contains
the most important (according to my subjective judgement) projects

---
### Currently included:
Problem set 8 (tracks): web development.

That's it for now. I think this is the most important thing I've done.
