                    Once upon a time, in the Don't-You-Ever-Dare-Call-It-Easter-European country of Poland,
                    there was a checklist of traits that a group is likely to display if it is a sect. The
                    checklist was available on several catholic websites, though some mischievous brats
                    would post the checklist on other sites, especially those dedicated to posting memes
                    so as to show that the Catholic Church would display 14 out of 18 sect traits by its
                    own definition <span class="xD">xD</span> A quick Google search will get you such a checklist, for example
                    <a class="halp" href="https://adonai.pl/zagrozenia/?id=127">this one</a>. Unfortunately (for you), it is in Polish,
                    which is not as widely spoken as English. This is why I'm posting a translation (not an absolutely 'word for
                    word' one, but it should be close enough and understandable) of it,
                    right below this paragraph, in English so that you can too laugh at the Church <span class="xD">xD</span>
                    for almost being a sect by its own definition <span class="xD">xD</span> So <span id="churchfox">
                    what does the Church say?</span>
                </p>
                <h2 id="sect_definition">Definition of a sect</h2>
                <ol id="the_definition">
                    <li>Even the first contact with the group has created a new way of perceiving the world.</li>
                    <li>The view of the world is really simple and explains every problem.</li>
                    <li>The group can offer you everything you've been fruitlessly looking for.</li>
                    <li>The group has a master/a leader/a Father/a Guru/the Greates Thinker (anything goes)
                    who is the only one who knows the truth.</li>
                    <li>The world is inevitably coming to an end and only the group knows how to save it.</li>
                    <li>The group is the elite. The rest of humanity is ill and lost. They cannot be saved if
                    they don't join the group.</li>
                    <li>The group rejects any science and teachings that aren't the groups own.</li>
                    <li>The group rejects rational thinking and the mind considering them negative, satanic and unenlightened.</li>
                    <li>Being criticized and rejected by the others proves that the group is right.</li>
                    <li>The group considers itself to be a true family of community.</li>
                    <li>The group wants you to break any relationships and bonds with your family, friends
                    and environment since they hinder your development.</li>
                    <li>The group separates itself from the rest of the world by different dress code, diet,
                    language etc.</li>
                    <li>The group demands strict obedience or discipline since it it the only way to salvation.</li>
                    <li>The group strictly regulates what is allowed in terms of sexual activity:
                    you may be forced to participate in group sex, ask the guru for permission, or be not allowed
                    any sexual activity if your rank is too low.</li>
                    <li>Your time will be filled with numerous tasks, e.g.: selling books, meditating, enlisting new members,
                    participating in courses etc.</li>
                    <li>If you don't get whatever you were promised (e.g.: success, cure, etc.) the group will
                    acknowledge the fact as your own fault: you should have been more engaged, prayed more,
                    believed more strongly or whatever...</li>
                    <li>You should become a member of the group <em>right now</em>.</li>
                    <li>It's not possible to get an objective image of the group. What matters is the experience, not reflections.
                    The rule is: <em>You simply cannot explain it. Please come to us and take part in a meeting. When you experience
                    it - you will finally understand</em>.</li>

                </ol>
                <h2 id="a_sect_we_are">Are we really a sect?</h2>
                <p id="yes_we_are">
                    No doubt that the Church seems to be a sect according to its own definition, but what about us?
                    We are quite average. No "greatest thinkers", no hostile attitude towards science etc...
                    It might appear to you that we aren't a real sect. This couldn't be further from truth!
                    We <strong>demand</strong> that you become as average as possible. You are obliged (but not as strictly
                    as in some other sects - we prefer more average pressure) to be as average as you possibly can! You
                    must have an average sex life, average income (feel free to choose either average, median or mean value,
                    whichever suits you, though whichever leads to the most average lifestyle is obviously prefered), average
                    life expectancy and so on... You are also expected not to be the best at being average - you should be
                    average at being average... and average at being average at being average... well, if you are averagely
                    intelligent then you should be able to understand what we mean... Remember: it is the non-average people
                    who change history. Hitler definitely wasn't average. His hate towards minorities was far above average.
                    Don't be like hitler. Be average.
