                    The-Typically-Worhiped-By-Average-Sects-Higher-Power-Or-Entity be praised,
                    Fellow Not-One-Of-Us Average Joe! As You have reached this part of the Internet,
                    we are really convinced that You aren't here by accident and You actively seek
                    spiritual guidance. There is a vast number of sects available but anyone uninitiated
                    might wonder which one of them is the most suitable one. As most of men and women
                    aren't far from average, we conclude that a totally average sect would be the best
                    for masses. But how can one know that he or she is average?
                </p>
                <h2 id="iq_header">A note about IQ</h2>
                <p id="index_iq">As an average person, you have probably heard about intelligence quotient,
                    IQ for short. However, it's quite likely that you misinterpret the way it works. You
                    might think that a person with 200 IQ is twice as smart as someone with just 100 IQ but it
                    doesn't work like this. What IQ measures is the <strong>deviation from the norm</strong>. This means that
                    IQ tests have to be standardized so that exactly half of the population scores 100 or below and
                    the other half scores 100 or above. A person with intelligence quotien of 100 is the most average
                    in terms of IQ as it is possible, provided the tests are properly <em>standardized</em> (and they are,
                    if you happen to live in the United Kingdom, but in other countries the average IQ might vary a bit).
                    There is also the notion of standard deviation. For simplicity, if we agree that the standard deviation
                    is 15 IQ points, then about 68% of people will score within the 85-115 IQ range which is considered average.
                    68% is a huge majority which means that you are <em>very likely</em> to be average at least in terms of IQ. IQ
                    between 70 and 85 is considered just below average while IQ between 115 and 130 is just above average.
                    Anything above is considered gifted and if you happen to score this high, you'd better look for a more
                    suitable sect. What about IQ below 70? Well, if you can read and understand this, then I, Average Joe,
                    the guru of this sect, am absolutely sure that you are not below 70 IQ. And take a look at this nice
                    graphic below showing the standard distribution of IQ in society.

                    IQ is not the only metric we can use to measure averageness. Anything that follows standard distribution
                    will work like IQ, I guess. I'd bet that height is such a metric: there are few really short or tall people
                    and a lot of... average. Income and wealth, unfortunatelly, are distributer very unevenly. Most of us earn
                    little or just enough to barely survive. Few can afford a lavish lifestyle. If 9 in 10 earn 1000 a month and
                    1 in 10 earn 11000 a month, then the average is (9 * 10 + 11000) / 10 = 2000 a month. 9 in 10 earn below average
                    in that setting. Thus it's better to use median value: sort the population by salary and take the value in the middle
                    (or the average of 2 salaries that are closest to the middle if the population is even). In the example
                    the median is 1000 obviously. Result: half of the population earns no more than the median
                    value and the other half earns no less. Thus using median might sometimes be a better idea
                    to determine whether you are average (and do belong here!) or not.
