# CS50x weeb development track.
---
This directory contains my cs50x web development track projects:
- Homepage (front end only: creating a page that looks somewhat decently was the goal)
- Finance (back-end focused: style did not matter for this project)

## IMPORTANT!:
Finance uses a cs50 python module which is available in the cs50 IDE.
This module was provided by the cs50 team to make the studets' lives
a little bit easier (especially when it comes to connecting with the SQL database).

Finance code is review-only if you don't have access to cs50 IDE (or can access
the cs50 library any other way). Moreover, this app uses an API key (and I'm NOT
providing mine) and a database (which I have intenionally cleared).

PS: as it is the case with many other cs50 projects, I've been provided with
some distribution code. All of the helpers.py comes from the distribution code, as well
as the login function and a bunch of other stuff.
Visit [the exercise page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/finance/) for the specs.
